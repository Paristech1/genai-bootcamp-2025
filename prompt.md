### **Sentence Structure Clues:**  
- **"My password and alarm"** â†’ Think about how to correctly join two nouns.  
- **"Are not working"** â†’ The verb **funcionar** needs to be in the correct form for **password + alarm** (third-person plural).  
- **"In my station"** â†’ Think about the correct preposition for location.

 Write your best attempt, and Iâ€™ll guide you further.  

Once you get it right, I will provide **two extra sentences** to help you deepen your understanding! ðŸš€

    You're very close! Here are some small corrections and explanations:  

    ### **Corrections & Explanations:**  
    1. **"Mi password" â†’ "Mi contraseÃ±a"**  
    - "Password" in Spanish is **"contraseÃ±a"** (avoid using English words).  

    2. **"y alarma" â†’ "y mi alarma"**  
    - In Spanish, repeating **"mi"** for the second noun makes it sound more natural.  

    3. **"no funcionan"** â†’ âœ… **Correct!**  
    - "Funcionar" needs to be conjugated in the **third-person plural** to match "contraseÃ±a y alarma."

    4. **"en mi estacion" â†’ "en mi estaciÃ³n"**  
    - **Spelling correction:** "EstaciÃ³n" (with an accent on the "o").

    ### **Final Corrected Sentence:**  
    **"Mi contraseÃ±a y mi alarma no funcionan en mi estaciÃ³n."** âœ…  

    Great work! Now, here are two more sentences using the words from your translation to **reinforce your learning:**  

    1. **"Si tu contraseÃ±a no funciona, revisa si la escribiste bien."**  
    _(If your password does not work, check if you wrote it correctly.)_  

    2. **"La alarma de la estaciÃ³n no suena por las noches."**  
    _(The station's alarm does not ring at night.)_
